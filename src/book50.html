          <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Main Theme</h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black
            Man by Emmanuel Acho is to facilitate honest and open conversations
            about race in America. Acho provides a platform for white people to
            ask questions about race and racism that they may feel uncomfortable
            or unsure about, and he shares his own experiences and insights to
            help deepen their understanding. The book aims to bridge the gap
            between people of different races, encourage empathy and
            understanding, and ultimately help promote racial healing and
            justice.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            Here are three key concepts that the book Uncomfortable
            Conversations with a Black Man by Emmanuel Acho discusses:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Systemic Racism: Acho explores the concept of systemic racism,
              which refers to the ways in which race-based discrimination and
              bias are embedded within the social, economic, and political
              systems of society. He provides examples of how systemic racism
              affects people of color in various areas of life, from education
              and employment to the criminal justice system.
            </li>

            <li>
              Privilege: Acho discusses the concept of privilege and how it
              shapes our experiences and opportunities in life. He explains how
              white privilege operates in American society and how it can be
              difficult for white people to see or acknowledge their own
              privilege. Acho also discusses the idea of intersectionality,
              which refers to the ways in which different forms of privilege and
              oppression intersect to create unique experiences.
            </li>

            <li>
              Allyship: Acho emphasizes the importance of allyship in the fight
              against racism. He discusses the ways in which white people can be
              effective allies to people of color, including educating
              themselves, speaking out against racism, and using their privilege
              to create change. He also emphasizes the importance of listening
              to and learning from people of color, rather than centering white
              perspectives in discussions about race.
