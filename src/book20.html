          <p class="mt-3">
            The Holy Bible, King James Version is a collection of religious
            texts and scriptures that form the foundation of the Christian
            faith. The main theme of the book is the story of God's relationship
            with humanity, the history of the Jewish people, the life and
            teachings of Jesus Christ, and the development of the early
            Christian church. The Bible is divided into two main sections: the
            Old Testament, which covers the time before the birth of Jesus, and
            the New Testament, which documents the life and teachings of Jesus
            and the early Christian church. The central message of the Bible is
            the love of God for all people, and the hope of salvation and
            eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            The Holy Bible, King James Version contains a vast array of
            concepts, teachings, and stories. It is difficult to narrow it down
            to just three concepts, as each reader may find different themes and
            messages within the text. However, here are three prominent concepts
            that the book discusses:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              God's relationship with humanity: The Bible presents God as a
              loving and compassionate creator who desires a close relationship
              with humanity. It tells the story of God's interactions with
              individuals and communities throughout history, including Adam and
              Eve, Abraham, Moses, the prophets, and ultimately, Jesus Christ.
            </li>

            <li>
              Sin and redemption: The Bible teaches that all humans are born
              with a sinful nature and are separated from God as a result.
              However, it also presents a message of redemption and salvation
              through faith in Jesus Christ. The death and resurrection of Jesus
              are central to this message, as they provide a way for humans to
              be forgiven and reconciled to God.
            </li>

            <li>
              Love and compassion: Throughout the Bible, there are countless
              examples of God's love and compassion for humanity, as well as
              teachings on how people should love and care for one another. One
              of the most famous passages on this topic is found in 1
              Corinthians 13, which describes love as patient, kind, and
              selfless.
