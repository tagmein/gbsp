          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book "The Collected Works of Ramana Maharshi"
            by Arthur Osborne is the teachings and philosophy of Sri Ramana
            Maharshi, a renowned Indian sage and spiritual teacher who lived in
            the early 20th century. The book is a collection of Ramana
            Maharshi's talks, conversations, and writings, which cover a wide
            range of spiritual topics, including self-inquiry, the nature of the
            self, the nature of reality, and the path to liberation. Ramana
            Maharshi's teachings emphasize the importance of self-knowledge and
            self-realization as the key to spiritual awakening and freedom from
            suffering. The book is considered a classic in the field of
            spiritual literature and has been a source of inspiration and
            guidance for many seekers on the spiritual path.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

            The book "The Collected Works of Ramana Maharshi" covers a wide
            range of spiritual topics, but here are three key concepts that are
            central to Ramana Maharshi's teachings:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Self-Inquiry: Ramana Maharshi's primary teaching is the method of
              self-inquiry, which involves questioning the nature of the self
              and seeking the source of the "I" thought. Through this process of
              introspection and self-inquiry, one can come to realize the true
              nature of the self as pure consciousness, beyond the limitations
              of the body and mind.
            </li>

            <li>
              Non-dualism: Ramana Maharshi's teachings emphasize the non-dual
              nature of reality, which means that there is no ultimate
              separation between the self and the world. He teaches that the
              self is not separate from the ultimate reality or the divine, but
              rather is identical to it. This realization of non-dualism is said
              to be the key to spiritual liberation.
            </li>

            <li>
              Surrender: While self-inquiry is the primary method for realizing
              the self, Ramana Maharshi also teaches the importance of
              surrendering to the divine or the ultimate reality. This surrender
              involves letting go of the ego and surrendering to a higher power,
              allowing it to guide and direct one's life towards spiritual
              realization.
            </li>
