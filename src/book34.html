          <p class="mt-3">
            Soul Cravings by Erwin McManus is a book that explores the human
            desire for meaning, purpose, and fulfillment. The main theme of the
            book is the idea that every human being has a deep longing for
            connection with God, and that this longing drives our pursuit of
            beauty, love, and truth. McManus argues that the human soul is
            constantly craving for something more, and that the only way to
            satisfy this craving is through a deep and authentic relationship
            with God. Throughout the book, McManus uses personal stories,
            biblical references, and philosophical insights to help readers
            understand and connect with their own soul cravings, and to guide
            them on a journey towards spiritual fulfillment.

            Soul Cravings by Erwin McManus discusses several important concepts
            related to the human desire for meaning and fulfillment. Here are
            three key concepts from the book:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The concept of soul cravings: According to McManus, the human soul
              has an insatiable craving for beauty, love, and meaning. He argues
              that this craving is universal and that it can only be satisfied
              through a deep and authentic relationship with God.
            </li>

            <li>
              The concept of the divine conspiracy: McManus argues that there is
              a divine conspiracy at work in the universe, whereby God is
              constantly working to bring about his purposes and to draw human
              beings into relationship with him. He suggests that this
              conspiracy can be seen in the beauty and order of the natural
              world, in the redemptive power of human relationships, and in the
              transformative work of the Holy Spirit.
            </li>

            <li>
              The concept of the heroic journey: McManus encourages readers to
              embark on a heroic journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth.
              He suggests that this journey involves facing one's fears,
              embracing one's passions, and learning to trust in God's guidance
              and provision. He also emphasizes the importance of community and
              relationship in the journey, arguing that we need others to help
              us navigate the challenges and to support us along the way.
