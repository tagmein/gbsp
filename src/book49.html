            The main theme of "Three Cups of Tea" is the power of education to
            overcome poverty, ignorance, and extremism. Mortenson's story
            demonstrates how education, particularly for girls, can lead to
            long-term positive change in impoverished communities. The book also
            highlights the challenges and obstacles faced by those working to
            improve the lives of people in such communities, including cultural
            barriers, political instability, and terrorism.
