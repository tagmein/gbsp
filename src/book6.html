          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book "The Center of the Cyclone" by Dr. John
            C. Lilly is his exploration of altered states of consciousness,
            including his own experiences with sensory deprivation, psychoactive
            drugs, and meditative practices. The book is a collection of essays
            and personal reflections that document Lilly's experiences and
            insights, as well as his theories on the nature of consciousness and
            its relationship to the human brain. Through his explorations, Lilly
            challenges conventional beliefs about the nature of reality, and
            offers a new perspective on the human experience and the potential
            for personal growth and transformation.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            The book "The Center of the Cyclone" covers a wide range of topics
            related to altered states of consciousness and the nature of
            reality. However, here are three key concepts that are particularly
            prominent throughout the book:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The exploration of altered states of consciousness: The book
              explores various methods of inducing altered states of
              consciousness, including sensory deprivation tanks, psychoactive
              drugs, and meditation. Lilly reflects on his personal experiences
              with these methods, and the profound insights and revelations they
              have provided him.
            </li>

            <li>
              The nature of consciousness: Another important theme in the book
              is Lilly's theories on the nature of consciousness. He suggests
              that consciousness is not solely a product of the brain, but
              rather a fundamental aspect of the universe that permeates all of
              reality. He also explores the idea of a collective unconscious,
              and the possibility of communication with non-human entities
              through altered states of consciousness.
            </li>

            <li>
              The relationship between science and spirituality: The book also
              discusses the relationship between science and spirituality, and
              the limitations of scientific inquiry when it comes to
              understanding subjective experiences such as altered states of
              consciousness. Lilly argues that a new kind of science is needed
              that incorporates subjective experiences into its methodology, and
              that embraces the possibility of non-physical dimensions of
              reality.
