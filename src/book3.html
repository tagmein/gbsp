            I'm sorry, but I don't have any record or knowledge of the book
            "Better Capitalism" by Paul E Knowlton, as my training data only
            goes up to September 2021. However, I can provide a general answer
            about what the main theme of a book on capitalism might be.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of a book on capitalism could vary depending on the
            author's perspective and focus, but generally, it might explore the
            nature, history, and impact of capitalism as an economic system. The
            book may discuss the origins of capitalism, its key features, and
            how it has evolved over time. It might also analyze the benefits and
            drawbacks of capitalism, its role in shaping society and politics,
            and the challenges it poses for achieving economic growth, social
            justice, and environmental sustainability. Additionally, the book
            could propose reforms or alternatives to capitalism aimed at making
            it more equitable, efficient, and sustainable.
