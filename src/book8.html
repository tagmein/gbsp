          Confronting Jesus
        </h3>

        <section>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">
            In this chat we are discussing the book Confronting Jesus by Rebecca
            McLaughlin. What is the main theme of the book?
          </h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book is an exploration of who Jesus is and why
            he matters, particularly for people who are skeptical or unsure
            about Christianity. The author examines various aspects of Jesus'
            life and teachings, and engages with common objections and questions
            that people have about Christianity. McLaughlin also draws on her
            own personal experiences and challenges readers to consider the
            implications of Jesus' life and message for their own lives.
            Ultimately, the book aims to help readers confront Jesus in a way
            that is intellectually honest and personally meaningful.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The Identity of Jesus: The book explores the question of who Jesus
              is and why he matters. The author discusses the historical
              evidence for Jesus' life and teachings, as well as his claims to
              be the Son of God. McLaughlin also addresses common objections to
              the idea of Jesus as a divine figure.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Message of Jesus: McLaughlin delves into the core message of
              Jesus, including his teachings on love, forgiveness, and
              salvation. She discusses the implications of Jesus' message for
              how we should live our lives, as well as the relevance of his
              teachings in our modern world.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Relevance of Jesus Today: The author addresses the question of
              whether Jesus is still relevant today, given the many changes and
              challenges that our society faces. McLaughlin argues that Jesus'
              message is still highly relevant, and that his teachings offer a
              compelling vision for how we can live our lives in a meaningful
              and fulfilling way.
