          <p class="mt-3">
            Good Or God by John Bevere explores the difference between living a
            good life and living a life that is fully aligned with God's will
            and purpose. The main theme of the book is the distinction between
            the cultural definition of "good" and the biblical definition of
            what it means to be truly good in the eyes of God.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Bevere argues that many people have settled for a comfortable,
            self-centered version of Christianity that emphasizes personal
            happiness and success, rather than seeking to fully submit to God's
            will and live a life that is truly good in His eyes. He encourages
            readers to examine their own lives and motivations, and to seek to
            align themselves more fully with God's will and purpose, even if it
            requires sacrifice and discomfort.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Overall, the book is a call to pursue a deeper, more meaningful
            relationship with God, and to live a life that is truly good in His
            eyes, rather than settling for a superficial or worldly version of
            goodness.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            There are several important concepts discussed in the book Good Or
            God by John Bevere, but here are three of the most significant:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The difference between good and God: Bevere argues that there is a
              fundamental distinction between what our culture considers to be
              "good" and what it means to truly live in alignment with God's
              will and purpose. He contends that many Christians have settled
              for a comfortable, self-centered version of faith that focuses on
              personal happiness and success rather than fully submitting to
              God's will.
            </li>

            <li>
              The importance of discernment: Throughout the book, Bevere
              emphasizes the importance of discernment - the ability to
              distinguish between right and wrong, truth and deception. He
              argues that in order to truly align ourselves with God's will, we
              must be able to recognize and resist the many forms of deception
              that can lead us astray.
            </li>

            <li>
              The cost of discipleship: Finally, Good Or God challenges readers
              to consider the cost of following Jesus. Bevere argues that true
              discipleship requires sacrifice and a willingness to embrace
              discomfort and even suffering. He encourages readers to examine
              their own lives and motivations, and to seek to align themselves
              more fully with God's will, even if it requires giving up personal
              comfort or security.
