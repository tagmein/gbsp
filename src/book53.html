          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by
            Michael C Feathers is to provide practical techniques and strategies
            for modifying, testing, and understanding legacy code, which is the
            existing codebase that may not have been designed for
            maintainability or testability. The book offers guidance on how to
            make changes to legacy code in a way that reduces the risk of
            introducing defects, and how to add tests to code that wasn't
            originally designed for testing. It also emphasizes the importance
            of understanding the codebase and its dependencies in order to make
            effective changes. Overall, the book aims to help software
            developers and engineers work with and improve legacy codebases in a
            productive and efficient manner.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            The book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" covers several key
            concepts and techniques for working with legacy code. Here are three
            of the top concepts discussed in the book:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The concept of "seams": In the book, Feathers introduces the idea
              of "seams" in code, which are areas where the code can be changed
              without affecting the rest of the system. Seams can be used to
              introduce new functionality or modify existing functionality in
              legacy code without introducing defects or breaking the system.
            </li>

            <li>
              Techniques for writing tests for legacy code: One of the biggest
              challenges with legacy code is that it often wasn't designed with
              testing in mind. The book covers several techniques for writing
              tests for legacy code, including the use of test doubles (such as
              mock objects and test stubs) and the creation of characterization
              tests to understand the behavior of existing code.
            </li>

            <li>
              Strategies for making incremental changes to legacy code: The book
              emphasizes the importance of making incremental changes to legacy
              code rather than attempting to rewrite the entire codebase from
              scratch. Feathers offers strategies for making small, safe changes
              to legacy code, such as refactoring code into smaller, more
              manageable pieces and introducing new features through the use of
              "sprout" classes that can be gradually integrated into the
              existing codebase.
