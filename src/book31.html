            In this chat we are discussing the book Ratio by Michael Ruhlman.
            What is the main theme of the book?
          </h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Ratio by Michael Ruhlman is a cookbook that focuses on the
            fundamental ratios that form the basis of many classic dishes and
            baked goods. The main theme of the book is to teach readers how to
            understand and apply these ratios to create their own variations of
            these dishes, rather than relying on specific recipes. Ruhlman
            argues that by understanding these ratios, home cooks can become
            more confident in the kitchen and create their own unique dishes
            without the need for step-by-step instructions. The book covers a
            wide range of ratios, from those used in bread baking and pastry
            making to those used in sauces, stocks, and custards.

          <p class="my-3">
            Here are three key concepts discussed in the book Ratio by Michael
            Ruhlman:

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The importance of ratios in cooking and baking: Ruhlman argues
              that understanding the ratios of ingredients in a recipe is more
              important than following the recipe itself. By learning the ratios
              that form the basis of different types of dishes, such as bread,
              pasta, and custards, home cooks can create their own unique
              variations of these dishes without relying on a specific recipe.
            </li>

              The versatility of basic recipes: Ruhlman provides several basic
              recipes, such as a basic bread dough or a basic vinaigrette, and
              shows how they can be adapted and customized by changing the
              ratios of ingredients. This encourages home cooks to experiment
              and be creative in the kitchen.
            </li>

            <li>
              The relationship between cooking and math: Ratio emphasizes the
              importance of understanding basic math concepts, such as fractions
              and percentages, in cooking and baking. Ruhlman argues that by
              understanding the math behind cooking, home cooks can become more
              precise in their measurements and more confident in their ability
              to create delicious dishes.
