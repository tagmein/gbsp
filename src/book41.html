          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of "The Daniel Dilemma" by Chris Hodges is how
            Christians can navigate living in a secular world while staying true
            to their faith and convictions. The book draws inspiration from the
            biblical story of Daniel and his experiences living in Babylon, and
            offers practical guidance for Christians who want to follow in his
            footsteps. Hodges addresses a range of topics such as moral
            relativism, tolerance, and standing up for one's beliefs, while
            encouraging readers to live out their faith with courage and
            compassion. Overall, the book seeks to equip Christians to engage
            with the world around them in a positive and impactful way, without
            compromising their beliefs.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            "The Daniel Dilemma" by Chris Hodges covers a wide range of concepts
            related to how Christians can navigate living in a secular world
            while staying true to their faith. Here are three of the top
            concepts discussed in the book:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Moral Relativism: The book discusses the concept of moral
              relativism, which is the belief that morality is subjective and
              varies depending on the individual or society. Hodges argues that
              Christians must reject moral relativism and instead base their
              beliefs on the absolute truth of God's Word.
            </li>

            <li>
              Tolerance: The book also explores the concept of tolerance, which
              is often seen as a virtue in today's society. However, Hodges
              suggests that Christians should be careful not to confuse
              tolerance with compromise, and should instead remain steadfast in
              their beliefs while showing respect and kindness to those who hold
              different views.
            </li>

            <li>
              Courage: Finally, "The Daniel Dilemma" emphasizes the importance
              of courage for Christians who want to make a positive impact in
              the world. Hodges encourages readers to stand up for what they
              believe in, even when it is difficult or unpopular, and to do so
              with compassion and grace. He believes that Christians who have
              the courage to live out their faith can make a significant
              difference in their communities and the world at large.
