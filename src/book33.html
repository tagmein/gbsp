          <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Main Theme</h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of Siddhartha: an Indian Tale by Herman Hesse is the
            spiritual journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. The novel
            explores the story of a young Brahmin named Siddhartha who embarks
            on a quest for spiritual understanding and fulfillment, ultimately
            finding enlightenment through his own experiences and reflections.
            Along the way, Siddhartha encounters a variety of characters and
            experiences, including ascetics, merchants, and even the Buddha
            himself, each of which provides him with new insights and teachings.
            Throughout the novel, Hesse explores the themes of self-discovery,
            the search for meaning, the nature of suffering, and the importance
            of finding one's own path in life.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The pursuit of spiritual enlightenment: The primary concept
              explored in Siddhartha is the quest for spiritual enlightenment.
              The novel follows Siddhartha's journey as he seeks to transcend
              his ordinary existence and attain a state of higher consciousness.
              This involves rejecting traditional paths and dogmas, and instead
              relying on his own intuition and experience to find his way.
            </li>

            <li>
              The cyclical nature of life: Another key concept in the novel is
              the cyclical nature of life. Throughout the story, Hesse
              emphasizes the idea that everything is interconnected and that all
              things are constantly changing and evolving. He illustrates this
              through Siddhartha's repeated cycles of growth and transformation,
              as well as through his descriptions of natural cycles like the
              seasons and the river's flow.
            </li>

            <li>
              The importance of individuality and self-discovery: A third
              central concept in Siddhartha is the importance of individuality
              and self-discovery. Siddhartha's journey is ultimately a search
              for his true self, and he must reject the teachings and influences
              of others in order to find his own path. Hesse emphasizes that
              each individual must follow their own unique path in life, rather
              than blindly accepting the beliefs and values of others.
