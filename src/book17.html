            Frugal Innovation by Navi Radjou explores the concept of frugal
            innovation and how it can be used as a mindset to create affordable
            and sustainable solutions for global challenges. The book argues
            that frugal innovation is not just about creating low-cost products,
            but also about developing resourceful, inclusive, and sustainable
            systems that can address the needs of people with limited resources.
            The book showcases examples of frugal innovation from around the
            world and provides practical advice for businesses, entrepreneurs,
            and policymakers to adopt frugal innovation practices to solve
            complex problems in a sustainable and responsible manner.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

          <p class="my-3">
            The book Frugal Innovation by Navi Radjou covers a range of concepts
            related to frugal innovation, but here are three of the most
            important:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Frugal innovation mindset: The book emphasizes the importance of
              adopting a frugal innovation mindset, which involves finding
              creative ways to do more with less. This mindset involves thinking
              about innovation not just in terms of technology and gadgets, but
              also in terms of creating value for customers and society with
              limited resources.
            </li>

            <li>
              Resource constraints as opportunities: The book argues that
              resource constraints can be seen as opportunities for innovation,
              rather than obstacles. By embracing limitations and focusing on
              creating simple, affordable solutions, innovators can find new and
              better ways to solve problems and create value.
            </li>

            <li>
              Inclusive innovation: Frugal innovation is not just about creating
              low-cost products, but also about making sure that these products
              and services are accessible and relevant to people with limited
              resources. The book emphasizes the importance of inclusive
              innovation, which involves involving users in the design process,
              understanding their needs and constraints, and creating solutions
              that meet their needs in a sustainable and responsible manner.
