          <p class="mt-3">
            Breathing Under Water by Richard Rohr is a spiritual self-help book
            that explores the idea of addiction and recovery through a Christian
            lens. The main theme of the book is that the path to spiritual
            growth and transformation is similar to the path of recovery from
            addiction. Rohr argues that everyone is addicted to something,
            whether it be substances, people, money, power, or status. He
            believes that the root of all addiction is a deep-seated sense of
            disconnection from ourselves, others, and God.

          <p class="mt-3">
            Through a series of meditations and reflections, Rohr offers a
            framework for understanding addiction and recovery as a spiritual
            journey. He draws on Christian teachings and the wisdom of the
            Twelve-Step program to explore the stages of transformation that are
            necessary for recovery from addiction, including surrender,
            awareness, confession, forgiveness, and transformation. Ultimately,
            Rohr argues that the path of recovery is a path of spiritual
            awakening, and that true healing comes from a deep connection with
            God, ourselves, and others.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            There are many important concepts discussed in Breathing Under Water
            by Richard Rohr, but here are three key ideas that stand out:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Addiction as a universal human experience: Rohr argues that
              addiction is not just a problem for a few individuals, but is a
              universal human experience. He believes that addiction is rooted
              in a deep-seated sense of disconnection from ourselves, others,
              and God, and that we all have a natural tendency to seek ways to
              numb our pain and distract ourselves from our inner turmoil.
            </li>

            <li>
              The importance of surrender and letting go: One of the key themes
              in the book is the idea of surrendering our will and our lives to
              a higher power. Rohr emphasizes the importance of letting go of
              our ego-driven desires and allowing God to work in our lives. He
              believes that surrender is a crucial step in the process of
              recovery and spiritual growth.
            </li>

            <li>
              The path of transformation: Rohr offers a framework for
              understanding the path of transformation that is necessary for
              recovery and spiritual growth. He draws on Christian teachings and
              the Twelve-Step program to explore the stages of surrender,
              awareness, confession, forgiveness, and transformation. He
              emphasizes that true healing and transformation come from a deep
              connection with God, ourselves, and others, and that this
              connection requires us to be vulnerable, honest, and open to the
              grace of God.
