            In this chat we are discussing the book Conscious by Annaka Harris.
            What is the main theme of the book?
          </h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Conscious by Annaka Harris explores the nature of consciousness,
            examining the latest scientific research and philosophical
            perspectives on the topic. The book's main theme is to present the
            idea that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe,
            rather than a byproduct of brain activity. Harris argues that
            consciousness is not limited to human beings and other animals, but
            may be a property of all matter in the universe, in various degrees
            of complexity. She also explores the implications of this view for
            our understanding of the mind, free will, and the nature of reality.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

          <p class="my-3">
            It's difficult to narrow down the top 3 concepts from a book as rich
            and multifaceted as Conscious, but here are three key concepts that
            are central to the book's argument:

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Consciousness as a fundamental aspect of the universe: Harris
              argues that consciousness is not simply a byproduct of brain
              activity, but rather a fundamental aspect of the universe that
              exists at all levels of complexity, from subatomic particles to
              human beings.
            </li>

            <li>
              The illusion of the self: Harris explores the idea that our sense
              of being a distinct and continuous "self" is an illusion created
              by the brain. She argues that the self is a construct that arises
              from the continuous stream of thoughts, perceptions, and
              sensations that make up our experience.
            </li>

            <li>
              The implications of a panpsychist view of consciousness: Harris
              considers the implications of the idea that consciousness is a
              fundamental aspect of the universe for our understanding of the
              mind, free will, and the nature of reality. She suggests that a
              panpsychist view of consciousness may lead to a more holistic and
              interconnected understanding of the universe, and could challenge
              some of our assumptions about the nature of reality.
