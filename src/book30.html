          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung,"
            also known as the "Little Red Book," is Mao Tse-Tung's political and
            ideological philosophy, which is a form of communism known as
            Maoism. The book is a collection of Mao's quotes and speeches,
            covering various aspects of Marxist theory and the practical
            application of communism in China. Mao believed in the importance of
            continuous revolution and the need for the proletariat, or the
            working class, to seize power from the bourgeoisie, or the
            capitalist class, in order to establish a socialist society. The
            book became an important tool for spreading Maoist ideology during
            China's Cultural Revolution and had a significant impact on the
            political and social climate of China during that time.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            The book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung" covers a wide range
            of concepts related to Maoist ideology. Here are three of the most
            prominent concepts discussed in the book:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Class Struggle: Mao believed that history is shaped by the
              struggle between different social classes, particularly the
              bourgeoisie and the proletariat. He believed that the proletariat
              must continuously struggle against the bourgeoisie in order to
              overthrow their oppressors and establish a socialist society.
            </li>

            <li>
              People's War: Mao advocated for the use of guerrilla warfare and
              the mobilization of the masses to overthrow the ruling class. He
              believed that the people, particularly the peasants, were the true
              driving force behind revolution and that a well-organized and
              disciplined people's army could defeat a much larger,
              better-equipped enemy.
            </li>

            <li>
              Cultural Revolution: Mao believed that a revolutionary spirit and
              constant self-criticism were necessary to prevent the emergence of
              a new bourgeois class and maintain the purity of the communist
              ideology. He launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966 to purge
              what he saw as capitalist and traditionalist elements from Chinese
              society and promote revolutionary values among the younger
              generation.
