          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of the book "Clean Architecture" by Robert C Martin
            is to guide software developers in designing and implementing
            software systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend
            over time. The book presents a set of principles and patterns for
            creating modular, testable, and maintainable software architectures
            that are loosely coupled, highly cohesive, and independent of
            specific technologies or frameworks. The author emphasizes the
            importance of separating business logic from technical
            implementation details, and provides guidelines for structuring
            software systems in layers, components, and services that enforce
            clear boundaries and interfaces. Overall, the book aims to help
            software developers create software that is both reliable and
            adaptable to changing requirements and technologies.

            The book "Clean Architecture" by Robert C Martin covers a range of
            concepts related to software architecture and design. Here are the
            top 3 concepts that the book discusses:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              The Dependency Rule: This is one of the fundamental concepts of
              the book, which states that the dependencies between components in
              a software system should always point inward towards the
              higher-level policies, and never outward towards the lower-level
              details. This ensures that the higher-level policies are not
              affected by changes in the lower-level details, making the system
              more modular and easier to maintain.
            </li>

            <li>
              The SOLID Principles: This is a set of five design principles that
              help developers create software systems that are easy to
              understand, maintain, and extend over time. The principles are
              Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface
              Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles promote
              code that is loosely coupled, highly cohesive, and independent of
              specific technologies or frameworks.
            </li>

            <li>
              Component-based Architecture: This is an approach to software
              design that emphasizes the separation of concerns by breaking down
              a system into smaller, reusable components. The components should
              have well-defined interfaces and be loosely coupled, which makes
              them easier to test and maintain. The book presents different
              strategies for organizing components into layers, services, and
              modules, depending on the specific needs of the system.
