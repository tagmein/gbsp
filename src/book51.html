          <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Main Theme</h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Under Cover by John Bevere is a Christian book that discusses the
            importance of submission to authority, both in the spiritual and
            natural realms. The main theme of the book is that God has
            established a system of authority in the world, and it is the
            responsibility of every Christian to submit to and honor those in
            positions of authority over them, whether in the church, government,
            workplace, or family.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Bevere argues that disobedience to authority is a form of rebellion,
            and can lead to negative consequences both in this life and in the
            spiritual realm. Conversely, submission to authority brings
            blessings and protection, as well as a greater understanding of
            God's ultimate authority.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            Throughout the book, Bevere uses biblical examples and personal
            stories to illustrate the importance of submission to authority, and
            provides practical guidance on how to submit in a way that honors
            God and respects those in authority.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Submission to Authority: The book's main theme is the importance
              of submitting to authority. Bevere argues that God has established
              a system of authority in the world, and that we must honor and
              submit to those in positions of authority over us, whether in the
              church, government, workplace, or family. He also discusses the
              consequences of disobedience to authority and the benefits of
              submission.
            </li>

            <li>
              Rebellion: Another important concept in the book is rebellion.
              Bevere discusses how disobedience to authority is a form of
              rebellion against God's established order, and can lead to
              negative consequences both in this life and in the spiritual
              realm. He emphasizes the need to repent of rebellion and submit to
              authority in order to experience God's blessings and protection.
            </li>

            <li>
              Fear of God: The book also emphasizes the importance of having a
              healthy fear of God. Bevere argues that the fear of God is not a
              negative emotion, but a reverence and respect for God's authority
              and power. He emphasizes that our submission to authority is
              ultimately rooted in our submission to God, and that a proper fear
              of God will lead us to honor and obey those in positions of
              authority over us.
            </li>
