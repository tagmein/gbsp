          <h4 class="text-xl font-medium">Main Theme</h4>

          <p class="mt-3">
            The main theme of The Communist Manifesto is the critique of
            capitalism and the advocacy for the establishment of a socialist
            society. Marx and Engels argue that capitalism creates a class
            struggle between the bourgeoisie (the capitalist class) and the
            proletariat (the working class), and that this struggle is
            inherently exploitative and unjust. They contend that capitalism is
            inherently unstable and that it will eventually lead to its own
            downfall, creating the conditions for a proletarian revolution that
            will establish a socialist society. The book also discusses the
            historical development of capitalism and the role of the state in
            capitalist societies.

            What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?
          </h5>

          <p class="my-3">
            The Communist Manifesto discusses several important concepts, but
            here are three of the most prominent ones:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-decimal grid gap-y-3">
            <li>
              Historical Materialism: Marx and Engels propose that historical
              development is driven by material conditions and economic
              relationships, rather than ideas or politics. They argue that
              economic systems evolve through various stages of development,
              with each stage characterized by specific social relations of
              production.
            </li>

            <li>
              Class Struggle: Marx and Engels assert that society is divided
              into two primary classes, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, who
              are in constant conflict with each other. The bourgeoisie, who own
              the means of production, exploit the proletariat, who must sell
              their labor power to survive.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Dictatorship of the Proletariat: Marx and Engels advocate for
              the establishment of a socialist society, in which the means of
              production are owned collectively by the workers. They argue that
              this can only be achieved through a proletarian revolution, and
              that during the transition to socialism, a temporary "dictatorship
              of the proletariat" will be necessary to suppress the resistance
              of the bourgeoisie and establish the conditions for a classless
              society.
