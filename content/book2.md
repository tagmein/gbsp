1. The origins and causes of World War II: Weinberg delves into the
   complex factors that led to the outbreak of war, including the
   Treaty of Versailles, the rise of fascism and militarism in

   by the Western powers. He also examines the impact of domestic

   truly global scale of World War II, with fighting taking place on
