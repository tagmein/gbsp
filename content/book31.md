<!-- Main Theme Details -->

Ratio by Michael Ruhlman is a cookbook that focuses on the
fundamental ratios that form the basis of many classic dishes and
baked goods. The main theme of the book is to teach readers how to
understand and apply these ratios to create their own variations of
these dishes, rather than relying on specific recipes. Ruhlman
argues that by understanding these ratios, home cooks can become
more confident in the kitchen and create their own unique dishes
without the need for step-by-step instructions. The book covers a
wide range of ratios, from those used in bread baking and pastry
making to those used in sauces, stocks, and custards.

##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

Here are three key concepts discussed in the book Ratio by Michael
Ruhlman:

1. The importance of ratios in cooking and baking: Ruhlman argues
   that understanding the ratios of ingredients in a recipe is more
   important than following the recipe itself. By learning the ratios
   that form the basis of different types of dishes, such as bread,
   pasta, and custards, home cooks can create their own unique
   variations of these dishes without relying on a specific recipe.
1. The versatility of basic recipes: Ruhlman provides several basic
   recipes, such as a basic bread dough or a basic vinaigrette, and
   shows how they can be adapted and customized by changing the
   ratios of ingredients. This encourages home cooks to experiment
   and be creative in the kitchen.
1. The relationship between cooking and math: Ratio emphasizes the
   importance of understanding basic math concepts, such as fractions
   and percentages, in cooking and baking. Ruhlman argues that by
   understanding the math behind cooking, home cooks can become more
   precise in their measurements and more confident in their ability
   to create delicious dishes.

##### The importance of ratios in cooking and baking

The concept of ratios in cooking and baking is central to Michael Ruhlman's book Ratio. Essentially, a ratio is a proportional relationship between two or more ingredients in a recipe. For example, a basic bread dough might have a ratio of 5 parts flour to 3 parts water. Understanding this ratio means that you can adjust the recipe depending on how much bread you want to make or the type of flour you're using, without having to rely on a specific recipe.

Ruhlman argues that by understanding the ratios that form the basis of different types of dishes, home cooks can become more confident and creative in the kitchen. Rather than simply following recipes, they can experiment with different ingredients and techniques to create their own unique variations of classic dishes.

To help readers understand the concept of ratios, Ruhlman provides a series of basic recipes and explains the ratios that form the foundation of each one. For example, he provides a recipe for a basic vinaigrette that has a ratio of 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar. By understanding this ratio, home cooks can make adjustments to the recipe based on their preferences, such as using a different type of vinegar or adding other ingredients like mustard or herbs.

Overall, the concept of ratios in cooking and baking is a powerful tool that can help home cooks become more confident and creative in the kitchen. By understanding the underlying ratios of different types of dishes, they can experiment with new ingredients and techniques and create their own unique variations on classic recipes.

##### The versatility of basic recipes

The concept of the versatility of basic recipes is another key theme in Michael Ruhlman's book Ratio. Essentially, Ruhlman argues that by understanding the basic ratios that form the foundation of many classic dishes, home cooks can create their own unique variations without having to rely on specific recipes.

To illustrate this concept, Ruhlman provides a series of basic recipes, such as a basic bread dough, a basic custard, and a basic vinaigrette. These recipes have been designed to highlight the ratios of ingredients that are common to many different dishes.

Once home cooks understand these basic ratios, they can start to experiment and make their own variations. For example, they might add different types of flour to a basic bread dough recipe, or use different types of vinegar in a vinaigrette recipe. By understanding the basic ratios, home cooks can create their own unique dishes without having to follow a recipe.

Ruhlman also emphasizes that by understanding the basic ratios, home cooks can be more confident in the kitchen. They don't have to worry about following a recipe exactly, and they can make adjustments based on their own preferences and the ingredients they have on hand. This encourages creativity and experimentation in the kitchen, which can lead to new and delicious dishes.

Overall, the concept of the versatility of basic recipes is a powerful tool for home cooks who want to become more confident and creative in the kitchen. By understanding the basic ratios that form the foundation of many classic dishes, they can create their own unique variations and experiment with new ingredients and techniques.

##### The relationship between cooking and math

The concept of the relationship between cooking and math is another important theme in Michael Ruhlman's book Ratio. Essentially, Ruhlman argues that understanding basic math concepts, such as ratios, fractions, and percentages, is essential for becoming a confident and successful home cook.

Many recipes require precise measurements of ingredients, and understanding basic math concepts can help home cooks be more precise in their measurements. For example, if a recipe calls for 1 cup of flour and you only have a 1/2 cup measuring cup, you can use basic math to measure out the correct amount of flour.

Ruhlman also emphasizes that understanding math can help home cooks be more confident in the kitchen. By understanding the basic math behind cooking and baking, home cooks can make adjustments to recipes based on their own preferences and the ingredients they have on hand. They don't have to rely on specific recipes or worry about making mistakes, because they understand the underlying math concepts.

Another example of the relationship between cooking and math is understanding the concept of percentages in cooking. For example, Ruhlman explains that a basic custard has a ratio of 2 parts liquid to 1 part egg, and that this translates to a 50/50 ratio by weight, or a 50% ratio. By understanding this concept, home cooks can adjust the ratio of liquid to eggs in a custard recipe to create a thicker or thinner custard, based on their preferences.

Overall, the concept of the relationship between cooking and math is important for home cooks who want to become more precise and confident in the kitchen. By understanding basic math concepts, they can make adjustments to recipes, experiment with new ingredients and techniques, and create their own unique dishes without having to rely on specific recipes.
