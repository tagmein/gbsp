<!-- Main Theme Details -->

Ratio by Michael Ruhlman is a cookbook that focuses on the
fundamental ratios that form the basis of many classic dishes and
baked goods. The main theme of the book is to teach readers how to
understand and apply these ratios to create their own variations of
these dishes, rather than relying on specific recipes. Ruhlman
argues that by understanding these ratios, home cooks can become
more confident in the kitchen and create their own unique dishes
without the need for step-by-step instructions. The book covers a
wide range of ratios, from those used in bread baking and pastry
making to those used in sauces, stocks, and custards.

##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

Here are three key concepts discussed in the book Ratio by Michael
Ruhlman:

1. The importance of ratios in cooking and baking: Ruhlman argues
   that understanding the ratios of ingredients in a recipe is more
   important than following the recipe itself. By learning the ratios
   that form the basis of different types of dishes, such as bread,
   pasta, and custards, home cooks can create their own unique
   variations of these dishes without relying on a specific recipe.
1. The versatility of basic recipes: Ruhlman provides several basic
   recipes, such as a basic bread dough or a basic vinaigrette, and
   shows how they can be adapted and customized by changing the
   ratios of ingredients. This encourages home cooks to experiment
   and be creative in the kitchen.
1. The relationship between cooking and math: Ratio emphasizes the
   importance of understanding basic math concepts, such as fractions
   and percentages, in cooking and baking. Ruhlman argues that by
   understanding the math behind cooking, home cooks can become more
   precise in their measurements and more confident in their ability
   to create delicious dishes.
