<!-- Main Theme Details -->

Conscious by Annaka Harris explores the nature of consciousness,
examining the latest scientific research and philosophical
perspectives on the topic. The book's main theme is to present the
idea that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe,
rather than a byproduct of brain activity. Harris argues that
consciousness is not limited to human beings and other animals, but
may be a property of all matter in the universe, in various degrees
of complexity. She also explores the implications of this view for
our understanding of the mind, free will, and the nature of reality.

##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

It's difficult to narrow down the top 3 concepts from a book as rich
and multifaceted as Conscious, but here are three key concepts that
are central to the book's argument:

1. Consciousness as a fundamental aspect of the universe: Harris
   argues that consciousness is not simply a byproduct of brain
   activity, but rather a fundamental aspect of the universe that
   exists at all levels of complexity, from subatomic particles to
   human beings.
1. The illusion of the self: Harris explores the idea that our sense
   of being a distinct and continuous "self" is an illusion created
   by the brain. She argues that the self is a construct that arises
   from the continuous stream of thoughts, perceptions, and
   sensations that make up our experience.
1. The implications of a panpsychist view of consciousness: Harris
   considers the implications of the idea that consciousness is a
   fundamental aspect of the universe for our understanding of the
   mind, free will, and the nature of reality. She suggests that a
   panpsychist view of consciousness may lead to a more holistic and
   interconnected understanding of the universe, and could challenge
   some of our assumptions about the nature of reality.
