biblical concept of the fear of the Lord, or the "awe" of God, and

##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

Here are three key concepts discussed in "The Awe of God" by John

1. The Fear of the Lord: The book explores the biblical concept of
   the fear of the Lord, which refers to a deep reverence and awe for
   God's holiness, power, and authority. Bevere argues that the fear
   of the Lord is a crucial aspect of our relationship with God, as
   it helps us to see Him in His true light and respond to Him with
   humility, obedience, and worship.
1. The Consequences of Sin: Another central theme of the book is the
   serious consequences of sin and the need for repentance and
   obedience. Bevere emphasizes that sin is not just a matter of
   breaking rules, but it is a direct offense against God's holiness
   and sovereignty. He urges readers to take sin seriously and turn
   away from anything that would hinder their relationship with God.

   God and His willingness to forgive and restore those who repent

##### The Fear of the Lord

Through these examples, Bevere highlights the importance of seeing God in His true light and responding to Him with humility, obedience, and worship.

Bevere also contrasts the fear of the Lord with other forms of fear, such as fear of man, fear of failure, or fear of the future.
