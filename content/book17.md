##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

The book Frugal Innovation by Navi Radjou covers a range of concepts
related to frugal innovation, but here are three of the most
important:

1.  Frugal innovation mindset: The book emphasizes the importance of
    adopting a frugal innovation mindset, which involves finding
    creative ways to do more with less. This mindset involves thinking
    about innovation not just in terms of technology and gadgets, but
    also in terms of creating value for customers and society with
    limited resources.
1.  Resource constraints as opportunities: The book argues that
    resource constraints can be seen as opportunities for innovation,
    rather than obstacles. By embracing limitations and focusing on
    creating simple, affordable solutions, innovators can find new and
    better ways to solve problems and create value.
1.  Inclusive innovation: Frugal innovation is not just about creating
    low-cost products, but also about making sure that these products
    and services are accessible and relevant to people with limited
    resources. The book emphasizes the importance of inclusive
    innovation, which involves involving users in the design process,
    understanding their needs and constraints, and creating solutions
    that meet their needs in a sustainable and responsible manner.
