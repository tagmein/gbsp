<!-- Main Theme Details -->

The main theme of the book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by
Michael C Feathers is to provide practical techniques and strategies
for modifying, testing, and understanding legacy code, which is the
existing codebase that may not have been designed for
maintainability or testability. The book offers guidance on how to
make changes to legacy code in a way that reduces the risk of
introducing defects, and how to add tests to code that wasn't
originally designed for testing. It also emphasizes the importance
of understanding the codebase and its dependencies in order to make
effective changes. Overall, the book aims to help software
developers and engineers work with and improve legacy codebases in a
productive and efficient manner.

##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

The book "Working Effectively with Legacy Code" covers several key
concepts and techniques for working with legacy code. Here are three
of the top concepts discussed in the book:

1. The concept of "seams": In the book, Feathers introduces the idea
   of "seams" in code, which are areas where the code can be changed
   without affecting the rest of the system. Seams can be used to
   introduce new functionality or modify existing functionality in
   legacy code without introducing defects or breaking the system.
1. Techniques for writing tests for legacy code: One of the biggest
   challenges with legacy code is that it often wasn't designed with
   testing in mind. The book covers several techniques for writing
   tests for legacy code, including the use of test doubles (such as
   mock objects and test stubs) and the creation of characterization
   tests to understand the behavior of existing code.
1. Strategies for making incremental changes to legacy code: The book
   emphasizes the importance of making incremental changes to legacy
   code rather than attempting to rewrite the entire codebase from
   scratch. Feathers offers strategies for making small, safe changes
   to legacy code, such as refactoring code into smaller, more
   manageable pieces and introducing new features through the use of
   "sprout" classes that can be gradually integrated into the
   existing codebase.
