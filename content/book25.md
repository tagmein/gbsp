He examines several of these prophecies, explaining how they were fulfilled in Jesus and how they point to his identity as the Messiah.

One such prophecy is found in the book of Isaiah, where it is foretold that the Messiah would be born of a virgin. Sobel explains how this prophecy was fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, who was born of a virgin, Mary. He also explores the significance of this prophecy, which speaks to the miraculous nature of the Messiah's birth and his divine nature.

Another prophecy Sobel examines is found in the book of Micah, where it is foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. Sobel explains how this prophecy was fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, who was born in Bethlehem, the same city where King David was born.

Sobel also explores how other prophecies were fulfilled in the life and mission of Jesus, such as his suffering and death, his resurrection, and his role as the Savior of the world. He argues that these prophecies affirm Jesus' identity as the Messiah and provide a foundation for Christian faith and hope.

Finally, Sobel discusses how understanding Messianic Prophecy can help Christians deepen their appreciation for the Bible and their faith. He explains how the prophecies in the Old Testament point to the coming of Jesus and how they provide a powerful witness to his identity and mission.
