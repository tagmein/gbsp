The concept of soul cravings is one of the central themes of Soul Cravings by Erwin McManus. According to McManus, the human soul has an insatiable craving for beauty, love, and meaning. He argues that this craving is universal and that it can only be satisfied through a deep and authentic relationship with God.

McManus suggests that our soul cravings are not simply desires for physical or material things, but rather they reflect our deepest longings for connection, purpose, and transcendence. He writes, "The soul has an infinite capacity to crave, to desire, to long for something more. And the more it craves, the more it is driven to find its satisfaction in something beyond itself."

McManus also notes that our soul cravings are often misunderstood or suppressed by modern culture, which tends to focus on materialism, individualism, and immediate gratification. He argues that this disconnection from our soul cravings can lead to a sense of emptiness, disillusionment, and despair.
