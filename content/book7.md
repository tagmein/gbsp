<!-- Main Theme Details -->

The main theme of the book "Clean Architecture" by Robert C Martin
is to guide software developers in designing and implementing
software systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend
over time. The book presents a set of principles and patterns for
creating modular, testable, and maintainable software architectures
that are loosely coupled, highly cohesive, and independent of
specific technologies or frameworks. The author emphasizes the
importance of separating business logic from technical
implementation details, and provides guidelines for structuring
software systems in layers, components, and services that enforce
clear boundaries and interfaces. Overall, the book aims to help
software developers create software that is both reliable and
adaptable to changing requirements and technologies.

The book "Clean Architecture" by Robert C Martin covers a range of
concepts related to software architecture and design. Here are the
top 3 concepts that the book discusses:

1. The Dependency Rule: This is one of the fundamental concepts of
   the book, which states that the dependencies between components in
   a software system should always point inward towards the
   higher-level policies, and never outward towards the lower-level
   details. This ensures that the higher-level policies are not
   affected by changes in the lower-level details, making the system
   more modular and easier to maintain.
1. The SOLID Principles: This is a set of five design principles that
   help developers create software systems that are easy to
   understand, maintain, and extend over time. The principles are
   Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface
   Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles promote
   code that is loosely coupled, highly cohesive, and independent of
   specific technologies or frameworks.
1. Component-based Architecture: This is an approach to software
   design that emphasizes the separation of concerns by breaking down
   a system into smaller, reusable components. The components should
   have well-defined interfaces and be loosely coupled, which makes
   them easier to test and maintain. The book presents different
   strategies for organizing components into layers, services, and
   modules, depending on the specific needs of the system.
