##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

The book "The Center of the Cyclone" covers a wide range of topics
related to altered states of consciousness and the nature of
reality. However, here are three key concepts that are particularly
prominent throughout the book:

1. The exploration of altered states of consciousness: The book
   explores various methods of inducing altered states of
   consciousness, including sensory deprivation tanks, psychoactive
   drugs, and meditation. Lilly reflects on his personal experiences
   with these methods, and the profound insights and revelations they
   have provided him.
1. The nature of consciousness: Another important theme in the book
   is Lilly's theories on the nature of consciousness. He suggests
   that consciousness is not solely a product of the brain, but
   rather a fundamental aspect of the universe that permeates all of
   reality. He also explores the idea of a collective unconscious,
   and the possibility of communication with non-human entities
   through altered states of consciousness.
1. The relationship between science and spirituality: The book also
   discusses the relationship between science and spirituality, and
   the limitations of scientific inquiry when it comes to
   understanding subjective experiences such as altered states of
   consciousness. Lilly argues that a new kind of science is needed
   that incorporates subjective experiences into its methodology, and
   that embraces the possibility of non-physical dimensions of
   reality.
