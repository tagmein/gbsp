##### What are the top 3 concepts that the book discusses?

"The Daniel Dilemma" by Chris Hodges covers a wide range of concepts
related to how Christians can navigate living in a secular world
while staying true to their faith. Here are three of the top
concepts discussed in the book:

   relativism, which is the belief that morality is subjective and
   varies depending on the individual or society. Hodges argues that
   Christians must reject moral relativism and instead base their
   beliefs on the absolute truth of God's Word.
1. Tolerance: The book also explores the concept of tolerance, which
   is often seen as a virtue in today's society. However, Hodges

   tolerance with compromise, and should instead remain steadfast in
   their beliefs while showing respect and kindness to those who hold
   different views.s
1. Courage: Finally, "The Daniel Dilemma" emphasizes the importance
   of courage for Christians who want to make a positive impact in
   the world. Hodges encourages readers to stand up for what they
   believe in, even when it is difficult or unpopular, and to do so
   with compassion and grace. He believes that Christians who have
   the courage to live out their faith can make a significant
   difference in their communities and the world at large.
