##### The Identity of Jesus 

The concept of the identity of Jesus is one of the key themes explored in "Confronting Jesus" by Rebecca McLaughlin. In the book, McLaughlin discusses the evidence for Jesus' life and teachings, as well as his claims to be the Son of God.

One of the key pieces of evidence for Jesus' existence is the New Testament documents, which were written by his followers in the decades following his death. These documents provide accounts of Jesus' life, teachings, and miracles, as well as his death and resurrection. 

McLaughlin notes that while some skeptics question the reliability of these documents, there is a broad consensus among scholars that they provide valuable historical information about Jesus.

Another key aspect of Jesus' identity is his claims to be the Son of God. McLaughlin discusses the significance of this claim and the various ways in which Jesus' contemporaries responded to it. She notes that some people rejected Jesus outright, while others were drawn to him and his message.
