<!-- Main Theme Details -->

The main theme of James Gilligan's book Violence: Our Deadly
Epidemic and its Causes is the exploration of the causes of violence
in society and the ways in which we can work to prevent it. Gilligan
argues that violence is not simply the result of individual
pathology or a lack of morality, but rather it is a social and
cultural phenomenon that is deeply rooted in our history, economy,
and political structures.

Gilligan examines various forms of violence, including homicide,
suicide, and self-harm, and argues that these behaviors are often
linked to experiences of shame, humiliation, and social exclusion.
He also explores the ways in which poverty, inequality, and
political oppression contribute to the prevalence of violence in our
society.

Throughout the book, Gilligan emphasizes the importance of empathy,
compassion, and social connection in preventing violence. He argues
that we must work to create a more just and equitable society that
values the dignity and worth of all individuals if we are to
successfully address the epidemic of violence.
